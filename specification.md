# TipShare App

## Idea

Food service workers get most of their income from tips left by customers. It can be hard to know how much tips one can make until you start working. Additionally it may seem untactful to bring up tip earnings during an interview. People should have the right to know how much money they can make before they decide to work at an establishment. The purpose of this app is to make possible earnings at restaurnats more transparent. Having more information about their possible earnings at a job can greatly help job-seekers make decisions, espcially for those that need to maintain a certain standard of living.
